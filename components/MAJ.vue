                <p class="text-center">MAJ (a.k.a. My Analog Journal) is a YouTube channel that curates vinyl-only mixes on
                    a weekly basis.
                    Every mix focuses on a certain genre, country, or region, era, or simply an idea or a theme.

                    It all started in late 2017 when Zag Erlat - Istanbul-born, London-based music producer, filmmaker,
                    record collector, DJ and the host of the MAJ Youtube channel - decided to play his Turkish records from
                    the ‘70s, which was the golden era of Turkish psychedelic rock music; after he realised that there
                    aren’t any vinyl sets focusing on this genre, on Youtube. Shortly after, his sets gained some attention
                    and very positive feedback from all around the world.

                    Zag found his new passion and desire to create more vinyl-only episodes and share the music he loves
                    with the people of the internet, which eventually turned into an online community.</p>
